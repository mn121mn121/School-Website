            On the eve of the Tagore Centenary year in 1961, Soumendranath Tagore, a descendant of Rabindranath Tagore came to Jamshedpur 
            and in course of his address he emphasised the necessity of forming a society to propagate the culture and philosophy of Rabindranath Tagore. 
            Inspired by Soumendranath, the like minded organisations running on the ideals of Tagore 
            were clubbed together and thus The Tagore Society, Jamshedpur was established in 1961.
            By the initiation of Sir J.J Gandhi, former Managing Director of Tata Steel a piece of 
            land in the central part of the town was given and the foundation stone of Rabindra Bhavan was laid 
            by the then Vice-President of India, Dr. S. Radhakrishnan. By the patronage of Tata Steel and with unconditional help 
            from the admirers of Tagore, a small but compact building with aesthetic beauty was gradually erected.

            In 1967, a school of music, 
            dance, art & craft was inaugurated by Mrs. Kamaladevi Chattopadhyay and within a short span of time it emerged as a principal training 
            centre in the eastern region of the country. It is worth mentioning that a good number of students could learn Rabindra Sangeet 
            under the able guidance of teachers like Subinoy Roy, Maya Sen, Sailaja Ranjan Majumdar and many other renowned teachers of that period. 
            Side by side in the area of classical vocal, students were taught by the then famous performers cum teachers like Sachin Das Motilal, 
            Prasun Bandopadhyay, Meera Banerjee and others. In the field of classical dance, stalwarts like Pt. Ramgopal Mishra and Prahlad Das 
            came regularly to teach the students. Some teachers of fine arts & crafts faculty who were the products of Visva Bharati University
             and Bengal Art College had joined this institution and some of them are still serving with best of their ability and efforts. 
             Gradually, six centers of the Tagore School of Arts were opened in the different corners of the town to facilitate the training 
             programme of music, dance and art.
